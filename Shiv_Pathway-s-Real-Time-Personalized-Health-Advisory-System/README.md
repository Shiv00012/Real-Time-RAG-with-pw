# Project Title

## Overview

This project is focused on [brief description of your project]. The static folder contains all the relevant files, including the demo video that illustrates key features.

## How to Run

[Provide steps to run the project or how to access files.]

## Introduction

The Real-Time Personalized Health Advisory System is designed to assist users with health-related queries by:

- Processing user inputs in real-time.
- Retrieving relevant data from various sources (PDFs, CSVs, etc.).
- Integrating weather conditions into advice.
- Providing audio responses using text-to-speech functionality.

## Technologies Used

### Pathway

**Pathway** is a real-time data processing framework used to update data streams dynamically. It allows efficient updates to large-scale projects, ensuring timely and accurate recommendations.

### LangChain

**LangChain** is an AI framework designed for building powerful, end-to-end applications with large language models (LLMs). It facilitates:

- Document splitting and embeddings.
- Prompt management for AI models.
- Integration with retrieval systems.

### LlamaIndex

**LlamaIndex** (formerly known as GPT Index) provides a simple interface for connecting LLMs with external data sources like databases, PDFs, and web data.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**RAG** is a method of improving LLM responses by retrieving relevant external data and incorporating it into the response generation process. This ensures factual accuracy and reduces hallucinations.

### Google API

The application leverages the **Google Generative AI API** for generating embeddings and powering the document retrieval system.

### GROQ API

**GROQ API** integrates with AI models like `ChatGroq` to provide high-quality and domain-specific conversational responses.

## Workflow

1. **Data Loading**:

   - Extracts data from supported file formats (PDF, CSV, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX).
   - Processes and splits data into smaller chunks for better embedding generation.

2. **Embedding Creation**:

   - Uses Google Generative AI to create embeddings for processed data.

3. **Vector Store**:

   - Stores embeddings in a FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) database for efficient retrieval.

4. **Weather Integration**:

   - Fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
   - Incorporates weather context into health recommendations.

5. **User Interaction**:

   - Users type their questions into a chat interface.
   - The system retrieves relevant data, processes the query, and generates personalized advice.

6. **Text-to-Speech**:
   - Converts bot responses to speech for a better user experience.

## Features

- Multimodal data processing from PDFs, CSVs, and more.
- Contextual health advice based on weather conditions.
- Real-time retrieval-augmented response generation.
- Voice-based interaction using GTTS.
- Easy-to-use chat interface for queries.
