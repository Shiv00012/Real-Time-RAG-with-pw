Leveraging Pathway‚Äôs Vector Store, Agentic Frameworks and Real-Time Data Updates

# Real-Time Agentic RAG with Pathway (Finance Domain)

üöÄ **An end-to-end real-time Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** leveraging Pathway‚Äôs Vector Store, multi-agent frameworks, and real-time data updates.

This project demonstrates a fully functional Agentic RAG pipeline tailored for the finance domain, where real-time information retrieval is critical for accurate decision-making. The system empowers AI-driven financial analysis by dynamically retrieving, verifying, and synthesizing multi-modal financial data from diverse sources.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Data Processing** ‚Äì Utilizes Pathway‚Äôs incremental indexing to ensure information is always up-to-date.
- **Agentic Query Execution** ‚Äì Employs a multi-agent approach with frameworks like LangGraph, CrewAI, or AutoGen for advanced reasoning.
- **Multi-Modal Data Handling** ‚Äì Processes financial PDFs, tables, and web data for comprehensive, accurate responses.
- **Adaptive Retrieval Strategies** ‚Äì Balances retrieval complexity and efficiency dynamically for optimal performance.
- **Tool-Enhanced Querying** ‚Äì Integrates APIs such as Yahoo Finance, Python Calculator, Edgar Tool, and Bing Web Search to address knowledge gaps.

---

## System Architecture

- **Data Ingestion** ‚Äì Parses PDFs (text, tables, images) and converts tables into HTML format for structured access.
- **Chunking & Storage** ‚Äì Extracts and processes text, indexing it efficiently in Pathway‚Äôs Vector Store.
- **Agent-Orchestrated Retrieval** ‚Äì Leverages an LLM-powered agent to fetch the most relevant data chunks.
- **Multi-Agent Reasoning** ‚Äì Dynamically selects external tools for additional data when required.
- **Query Execution** ‚Äì Delivers responses via a scalable REST API using Pathway‚Äôs serve method.
